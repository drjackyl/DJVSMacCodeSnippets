# DJVSMacCodeSnippets

A collection of daily-work code-snippets I use in Visual Studio for Mac (formerly known as Xamarin Studio).

The snippets are convenience-snippets for things I use a lot. They include snippets specific to MvvmCross, as it is part of our standard-setup of Xamarin-projects.

The .gitignore is setup to ignore all files except itself, the README.md, the LICENSE and all files beginning with "Dj".

## How to use these snippets

The naming-inconsistency has been resolved in v7, which is now renamed to Visual Studio for Mac: It's snippets everywhere - no more templates.

The user's code-snippets in Visual Studio for Mac are located in

```
~/Library/VisualStudio/7.0/Snippets
```

If you didn't create your own code-snippets, yet and don't plan to do so, you can simply clone this repository to the path mentioned above. The folder won't exist, if you didn't create snippets, yet.

If you have your own code-snippets and want to add these, I suggest to clone these to any location and copy them to your Snippets-folder.
